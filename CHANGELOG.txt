Thank you to Dokucraft Contributor SyndiShadX for helping me fix the CTM issues with the stained glass panes. Sanacraft is indebted to you and all of Dokucraft. 

Optifine:
Restored the Optifine Componets - THESE WILL MOST LIKE BE BUGGY.

	Stained Glass - CTM enabled, but no CTM textures unless I become less lazy. 

	Brick Slabs - Stack them together.. see what you get. 

	New blocks are a possibility with stacked slabs. 

	Easter Eggs - rename items.. see what you get.

	Few new textures. Sticks, Sugar, String..

DynMap:
Restored some textures to their default position as moving them apparently messes with the Dynmap.

	Learn to follow code, you silly program! (Impy says even though this is usually the cause of 		bugs..)
