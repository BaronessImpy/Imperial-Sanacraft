Imperial Sanacraft 1.16 Version: Uncle
Managed by ImperialPhoenix, known as BaronessImpy
------------------------

This is the Imperial Sanacraft 1.16 resource pack. This release may contain minor bugs, broken models or textures. If bug or missing textures are found (Purple and black squares) please report to the Admiral Sana, to the Commodore Serephina or the Commodore MajorPayne or to any remaining Commodores and Captains. Please try to note what block the error occurs on and how it was use. A screenshot will be very helpful if you can provide one.

The Sanacraft Resource Pack is designed for the Sanacraft Server by ImperialPhoenix. You may use this pack however you like outside of the Sanacraft server. Please be aware that we have altered many blocks for our own needs and they may not suit your needs.

------------------------

This texture pack is built off of the Dokucraft: The Saga Continues pack. Many textures have been taken from the Dokucraft STASH and I want to extend my thanks to those hard working artists. I appreciate them. Some of the textures and models have been made by Imperial_Phoenix and are free to use in anyway, in any pack, and on any server or game. I will be providing these in the future to the Dokustash. 

If you are responsible for any of the textures and wish them to be removed, please contact a Captain (Moderator), Commodore (Admin) or the Admiral (Owner) in game and advise them to notify me, ImperialPhoenix. Please specify the block or texture in question and provide a screenshot showing how the block is used.

Thank you!
